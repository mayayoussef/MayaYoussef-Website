        <div class="subheading mb-5">Tennis Coach ðŸŽ¾</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My journey to becoming a tennis coach was not an easy one. It has had its ups and downs but I am very grateful to be doing what I love to this day. I fell in love with the sport every since I first stepped out on the court when I was 4 years old. I was juggling multiple othet sports at the time but I remember that tennis was my favorite since the beginning because I would be the most excited to go to tennis practice than any other sport. Ever since I was little, my parents would call me 'Mayapova' after the now-retired professional tennis player Maria Sharapova. I looked up to her and many other players like her and decided that I wanted to be like them. As I grew up my dreams changed a little, I still wanted to pursue tennis but at the collegiate level (for now). This goal stayed with me through many moves from state to state, and school district to school district. Playing D1 tennis was the goal now. My life during my middle school and highschool years persisted of practicing at least 4 hours during the week and entering tournaments every weekend. I was very dedicated to tennis, but I still wanted a social life off the court. At a very young age, I had to learn how to balance school, tennis, friends, and family. It was very difficult at first, I struggled in some aspects as I prioritized others. However, I realized that I could benefit the most if I used all of these aspects together. For example, I could make tennis friends and the tournaments I was playing, which meant I could socialize and play the sport that I loved at the same time. One of the most important things that I learned from these experiences is time management. They key to balancing my priorities was learning how to manage my time and that everything had its own time and place. When I'm out on the court, i can't be thinking about the fun plans I had later that day with my friends. When I'm studying, I can't worry about how good or bad I was playing at practice, etc. Learning how to time manage is a great skill that I have brought with me into my coaching career. In all honesty, when I was looking into different careers, I never considered or was eager to become a coach. I actually thought it was a daunting job to have because of how they're always out in the sunny hot weather. Nonetheless, that changed when I landed my first coaching gig.      <br><br>

        It was the summer of 2018 when I first began coaching. Well, assisstant-coaching. My dad, brother, and I were out playing at our community tennis courts as we always did. My dad would feed my brother and I different drills and give us technical advice that he learned throughout the years from watching us play. He never played tennis at any point in his life, however, he proved to be a great visual learner. He always tended to be right, whether I was struggling with technical or mental challenges, his advice never disappointed. One day, my dad was running late to one of our practices so it was just my brother and I alone on the court. We began hitting and I found myself giving my brother tips on his footwork and racket swing. It came very naturally to me, and according to him I worded things in simple way that can be easily understood. When he started improving with every direction I gave him, the satisfaction I felt was unmatchable. On top of our practices supervised by my dad, we started playing on our own too. Whenever, my brother felt like he was in a funk he would come to me asking for advise. I loved helping him. Nonethless, my patience, leadership and ability to teach did not come out of nowhere, I am the oldest sister and cousin on both sides of my families. Being the oldest meant I had to take care of all of my cousins during our family vacations and adventures. I had to babysit, stop fights, feed, advise, and tell bed time stories to all of my cousins. Not only did this help me develop great skills to deal with children, it also showed me how much I actually liked being around them. Undoubtedly, they can be stubborn and annoying at times but I would so much rather spend the day in a room full of children than adults. I am eager to make a positive impact on their lives and if coaching is one of the ways i can do that so be it. One question I get asked a lot is why not be a teacher? The benefits and summer breaks are great but being a tennis coach has its own benefits. Not only am I getting my exercise and steps in, I also get to help young players by being the coach I always wanted to have when I was there age. I am able to connect with my players on a deeper and personal level, but we still have boundaries so that I don't lose their respect and maintain authority. I can sympathize with them since I have gone through all the struggles a tennis player can go through. Most importantly, I can show them that there is no ceiling and help them reach their best potential. I love watching people succeed and get better but I love it even more when I am able to help them get there.  <br><br>

        I have gotten many questions about whether or not I coach adults or not. The answer is yes, I can work with both young players and older players. I offer both private lessons and semi-private lessons. If you or someone you know is looking to improve their game, join us for top-notch fun tennis training. Private lessons are $70/hour and semi-private lessons are $40/hour. I can coach plaeyrs of all levels from beginners to professionals. Learning how to hone your skills and becoming mentally tough are some of the many things that I can teach. I am great listener, I will listen to your concerns and struggles and will help you work through them. Being an excellent motivator and optimist is another thing that I make sure to bring to the table so that players can have a positive environment to help them improve. I not only communicate but I can connect to the players so that they are aware of a trusting shoulder to lean on during tough times if they lack a proper support system. Lastly, I am always punctual. I respect your time and want you to respect mine so unless there is an emergency I will always either be on-time or early to our practices. In addition, in order to become a good tennis player, you must physically fit and have the stamina to be out on that court for however long you need to. I am partnered up with Xtreme Fitness to offer training for players at a discounted price. The trainer is a fitness instructor who is specialized specifically in tennis fitness training. Jay Cuver has been an instructor for 8 years and a great friend of mine who I met during college at one of the intercollegiate tennis events.

The workout will target and focus on things that will help you improve your game. In many instances, you may find trainers asking you to do extra heavy lifting or cardio, but with Xtreme Fitness, players can focus on improve their reaction time skills through short-distance sprinting and some lifting.
